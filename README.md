This cook book application was written in C# using Microsoft's Visual Studio.

I wrote this program as a convenient way for my mother to organize her huge collection of cook books that are falling apart.

This is missing a lot of features I had originally intended on creating because after I made this, I realized it only runs on Windows and my mother uses Ubuntu.
I am now going to rewrite this program as a web-app for multiplatform convenience.
